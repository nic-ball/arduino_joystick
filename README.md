# Arduino Powered PAC MAN Joystick

Using a simple sketch to get joystick input with the incorporated switch, plus an added tactile switch 
to be able to add credits to the game.

###Usage

Open `joystick_control.ino` into Arduino IDE and upload to your board.
For this Project I am using an Arduino Uno but should work with whatever your weapon of choice is.

<em>Please note:</em> If monitoring using serial monitoring ensure that it is set to 115200 baud otherwise the serial 
output is a mess.

###TODO  

* Work out how to get the analog and digital inputs interfaced with the Raspberry Pi.
* Get the prototype working
* Improve it!
